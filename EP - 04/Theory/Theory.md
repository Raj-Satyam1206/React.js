### Q: Is `JSX` mandatory for React?
A:  
- No, `JSX` is not mandatory for React, but it is the recommended and widely used way of defining the structure of your user interfaces when working with React.  
- React can be used without JSX, but JSX makes the process of defining and working with components in React much more convenient and readable.  
- We can write React components using plain JavaScript functions or classes, and create React elements using `React.createElement` function.   

Here's an example of creating a React component and element without JSX:
```
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, React without JSX!');

const App = () => {
    return React.createElement('div', null, element);
}
```
As you can see, it's less readable and more cumbersome compared to the JSX equivalent:

```
const element = <h1>Hello, React with JSX!</h1>;

const App = () => {
    return <div>{element}</div>;
}
```

### Q: Is ES6 mandatory for React?
A:  
- `ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)` is not mandatory for React, but it is highly recommended and widely used in React development  
Advantages:-
- `Enhanced Syntax` - ES6 introduces many features and syntactical improvements that make our code more concise and readable. Features like `arrow functions`, `template literals`, `destructuring`, and `classes` can significantly improve our code quality and maintainability.

`Module System` - ES6 introduced a standardized module system, allowing us to use `import` and `export` statements for better code organization in React applications.

`Arrow Functions` - Arrow functions provide a more concise way to define functions, and they have lexical scoping, making it easier to work with this in React components.

`Class Syntax` - ES6 class syntax is commonly used for defining React components, providing a clear and more structured way to create components.

`Spread and Rest Operators` - These operators are useful for working with arrays and objects, which are common in React applications.

### Q: How can I write `comments` in JSX?
A:  
- You can write comments in JSX using curly braces {} and JavaScript-style comments within them.  
`Single-Line Comments`::

**Example:**
```
<div>
    {/* This is a single-line comment */}
    <p>Hello, World!</p>
</div>
```  
<br/>
<br/>

`Multi-Line Comments`::

**Example:**
```
<div>
    {/*
        This is a multi-line comment.
        You can use it for longer explanations.
    */}
    <p>Hello, World!</p>
</div>
```

### Q: What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?
A:  
- Both `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>` are used in React to define `fragments`.  
- When a component returns multiple elements, these elements need to be wrapped inside a container element like "div" or "<>".  
- JSX returns a single root parent tag. 

1. `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` 
We can use the `<React.Fragment>` component to create a fragment in our JSX.

**Example:**
```
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <p>First paragraph</p>
            <p>Second paragraph</p>
        </React.Fragment>
    );
}
```

2. `<></> (Short Syntax, introduced in React 16.2)`
The short syntax `<></>` is a more concise way to create fragments in React. It has the same purpose as `<React.Fragment>`, but it doesn't require the React import.

Example:
```
function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <>
            <p>First paragraph</p>
            <p>Second paragraph</p>
        </>
    );
}
```

### Q: What is `Reconciliation` in React?
A:  
- `Reconciliation` in React refers to the process by which `React updates the DOM` so that it can `sync with the current state` of the application.  
- React uses a `virtual representation of the DOM` called the "Virtual DOM" to efficiently update the actual DOM.  
- Reconciliation is the algorithmic process of `comparing the previous virtual DOM with the current one` and making the necessary changes to bring the actual DOM in sync with the application's state.

Here's how the reconciliation process works in React
1. `Render Phase` - During the render phase, React creates a virtual representation of the component tree. This virtual tree is called the Virtual DOM.

2. `Reconciliation Phase` - When there's a change in the component's state or props, a new virtual tree is created. React then performs a process called `reconciliation` to compare the new virtual tree with the previous one.

React uses a `diffing algorithm` to identify the differences (or "diffs") between the new and previous virtual trees.  
It determines which parts of the virtual tree need to be updated in the actual DOM to reflect the changes in the component's state or props.

3. `Commit Phase` - After identifying the differences in the virtual tree, React applies the necessary changes to the actual DOM. This is called the `commit phase`. During this phase, React updates the DOM to reflect the changes in the virtual tree.

### Q: What is `React Fiber`?
A:  
- `React Fiber`, often referred to simply as `Fiber` is an internal and ongoing re-implementation of the React reconciliation algorithm.  
- It was introduced by the React team to address some limitations and performance bottlenecks in the original reconciliation 
process.

The primary goals of React Fiber are:
`Improved Rendering` - Fiber introduces a new, more efficient algorithm for rendering components. It allows React to break down rendering work into smaller units and prioritize the work more effectively. This enables React to be more responsive, especially in high-load and concurrent rendering scenarios.

`Incremental Rendering` - Fiber enables React to perform rendering incrementally, `pausing` and `resuming` work as needed. This means that React can work on rendering parts of the component tree without blocking the main thread, resulting in smoother and more responsive user interfaces.

### Q: Why do we need keys in React?
A:  
- In React, the key prop is used to uniquely idetify and differentiate components.Suppose, we have multiple components and we need to add an extra component , then,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If we have not used keys , then React will re-render all the components.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If keys are used, then Reactv will know exact place to place the component.

<br/>
- It helps React identify and differentiate between elements in a collection, such as when rendering a list of components or elements.  
- `Keys` are essential for efficient and reliable rendering. 

`Performance` - React uses keys to optimize the update process. When a component in a collection is modified, React can use the keys to identify exactly which item changed. This enables React to update only the changed component in the virtual DOM and minimize the number of DOM manipulations required, which significantly improves performance.

`Preventing Reordering` - Keys ensure that the order of elements in a collection remains consistent. Without keys, React may not be able to distinguish between elements effectively, leading to unintended reordering when elements are added, removed, or modified. Keys help maintain the desired order of elements.



However, it's important to note that keys should be unique among siblings but don't necessarily have to be globally unique. React uses keys to establish a relationship between the virtual DOM elements and the actual DOM elements. As such, keys are primarily used within the scope of the parent component to identify its children.

When choosing keys, it's a good practice to use stable and unique identifiers for elements, such as database IDs, UUIDs, or indices, depending on your data source. Avoid using random or non-unique values as keys, as they can lead to unexpected rendering behavior and performance issues.

**Example** :

```
<li key={0}>HTML</li>
<li key={1}>CSS</li>
<li key={2}>JavaScript</li>
<li key={3}>React</li>
```

### Q: Can we use the `index as keys` in React?
A:  
- Yes, we can use the `index as keys` in React, but it should be done with caution and only in specific situations where we are certain that the list of items in your component is `static and won't change`.  
- Using the index as keys can have limitations and potential issues, so it's important to understand when it's appropriate and when it's not.

Here are some key points to consider when using the index as keys:

`Static Lists` - The index can be used as a key when rendering a `static list of items`, where the order and the items themselves won't change. If our list is dynamic and items can be added, removed, or reordered, using the index as keys is not recommended, as it can lead to unexpected rendering issues.

`Performance` - Using the index as keys is less efficient in terms of performance, especially when elements can be added or removed from the list. `React may not be able to distinguish between items effectively`, leading to unnecessary re-renders and potentially impacting the performance of our application.

`Stable and Unique` - If we decide to use the index as keys, ensure that the list order remains stable. Any change in the list order can lead to incorrect rendering. Additionally, it's essential to use unique keys for each item in the list, as duplicate keys can lead to issues.

### Q: What is `props` in React? Ways to
A:  
- In React, `props (short for properties)` is a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component.  
- Props make our React components dynamic and reusable.  
- Props are read-only, meaning that a child component cannot modify the props it receives from a parent.

To pass props to a child component, you can use the following methods:

1. `Inline Props (JSX Attribute)` - We can pass props directly in our JSX when rendering a child component. For example, if you have a name prop, we can pass it like this:

```
<ChildComponent name="John" />
```

2. `Using Variables` - We can pass JavaScript variables as props to a child component. 
For example:
```
const name = "John";
<ChildComponent name={name} />
```

3. `Dynamic Props` - We can pass dynamic values or the result of expressions as props. For instance, we can pass the result of a function:
```
<ChildComponent greeting={`Hello, ${getName()}`} />

/* Here, getName() is a function that returns a name. */
```

4. `Spread Attributes` - If you have an object with properties that you want to pass as props, you can use the spread operator (...) to pass all properties of the object as individual props:
```
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
<ChildComponent {...person} />
```
In the ChildComponent, we can access **name** and **age** as individual props.

In the child component, we can access these props using the props object. For example, in the ChildComponent, you can access the name prop as `props.name`.

Here's a simple example of how a parent component can pass props to a child component:
```
// ParentComponent.js
import React from "react";
import ChildComponent from "./ChildComponent";

function ParentComponent() {
  return <ChildComponent name="John" />;
}

// ChildComponent.js
import React from "react";

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
}

export default ChildComponent;
```

In this example, the ParentComponent passes a name prop to the ChildComponent, and the child component displays a message using that prop. This demonstrates the basic use of props in React.

### Q: What is `Config Driven UI`?
A:  
- A `Config-Driven UI` (or `Configuration-Driven User Interface`) is an approach to building user interfaces where the structure, behavior, and appearance of the UI components are determined by configuration data or settings, rather than hardcoding these details in the source code.  
- This approach aims to make the user interface more flexible, customizable, and easily maintainable by separating the UI logic from the UI configuration.

`Config-Driven UIs are commonly used in various contexts, including`:

`Content Management Systems (CMS)` - CMS platforms often allow users to define the structure and content of web pages through a configuration-driven approach.

`eCommerce Platforms` - Online stores often rely on configuration data to specify product catalogs, pricing, and promotional banners.

**Example**

- Offers in the Delivery apps differ from city to city where offer data come from a database.
- Restaurants in the Delivery apps differ from city to city where offer data comes from a database.
